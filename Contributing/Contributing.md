#Contributing to a *Simulation using Best-fit Algorithm*
We welcome contributions but request that you follow these guidelines.

#Bugs

Please raise any bug reports on the project's issue tracker. Be sure to search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Also, provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

#New features

Please raise any new feature requests on the project's issue tracker.

#Pull requests

##Changes to existing code

If you want to raise a pull request with a new feature, or a refactoring of existing code, make sure to open an issue in the project's issue tracker first before engaging in serious development work. This will start a discussion and help in accepting the pull request.

##Coding standards

Please ensure you follow the coding standards used throughout the existing code base. Some basic rules include:

- All files must have the Apache license in the header.
- Indent 
- Document all part of your code

##Contributor License Agreement

In order for us to accept pull requests, the contributor must first complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its customers; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You can download the CLAs here:

- [individual] (https://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/SimBA/blob/master/Contributing/cla-individual.pdf)
- [corporate] (https://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/SimBA/blob/master/Contributing/cla-corporate.pdf)

If you are an *IBMer*, please contact us directly as the contribution process is slightly different.
